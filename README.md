### Printing things to the screen
Our first code is to print **Hello World** to the screen, in order to do that, we will need to use a $\textit{built in}$ function call print. 

```python
print("Hello World")
```

By doing so, we will be printing **Hello World** to the screen. If we look carefully, there are two **"** surrounding **Hello World**. When something that is sandwhiched by two **"**, it represents a **string**. One might ask, what is **string**? **string** is really referring to **word/(s)**.
For example, ```This is a word```, ```hi```, ```k```,```Jayden```, ```Chloe```, ```Claire```,and ```jeffrey is a monster``` will be considered as ```string``` in python. 

So, if we want to print ```i love programming in python```, first we have to include two **"** from the beginning of the string and at the end of the string which will look like this, ```"i love programming in python"```. From here, we simply add that string and put it in side the **(**some_string**)**. So we end up having ```print("i love programming in python")```

So to here is the template, you will need to replace __replace_your_own_string__ to what you would like to print. ```print("__replace_your_own_string__")```

In summary, string is just referring to word(s), where words include numbers and word(s) in general. 

### Variable
Variable, it is the same concept from math. However, some might not know what a variable yet, so lets talk about it for a second.

1. Think about this, if you adopt a dog or cat, what would you do first in general? You will give him / her a name right? So when we alott a name to a pet, a pet will have a name. 
2. When you were born, you do not have a name initially. So your parents gave you the name when they had one. 
3. When you mom asks you to clean up your room, you might find a storage box and put everything into the box so that you can organize things better right? Once you packed everything, you will give your box a name, toys, bunch of box or what ever you can imagine right? So, that box is a variable you simply give a name to it.

So, we are simply assigning some name to a box so that we can put something into the box. For now, we can name anything you would like, also, as for the values, it can be numbers or words.

for example, if we would to create a box that holds a number to represent your age, we can do the following:

1. 
```python
age = 20
```

We are simply saying, we name the box as age and we put the value 20 into age. So, the life span of this code, age will be always equal to 20. 

2.
```python
DogFoodPrice = 29.99
```
In this example, we want to put the price, 29.99, into box. And we would like to name the box as DogFoodPrice. So, during hte life span of this exceprt, DogFoodprice will be 29,99.

### Deep thinking,

How do we assign ```Jeffrey Chan``` into the box called name? In another word, create a variable call name and set it's value to ```Jeffrey Chan```.

### Logical statement
Logical statement will help us to decide what should we do based on different kind of situations. 

For example, 
1. **if** we are all hungry, lets go to eat some pizza. 
2. Lets vote for
