### Printing things to the screen
Our first code is to print **Hello World** to the screen, in order to do that, we will need to use a $\textit{built in}$ function call print. 

```python
print("Hello World")
```

By doing so, we will be printing **Hello World** to the screen. If we look carefully, there are two **"** surrounding **Hello World**. When something that is sandwhiched by two **"**, it represents a **string**. One might ask, what is **string**? **string** is really referring to **word/(s)**.
For example, ```This is a word```, ```hi```, ```k```,```Jayden```, ```Chloe```, ```Claire```,and ```jeffrey is a monster``` will be considered as ```string``` in python. 

So, if we want to print ```i love programming in python```, first we have to include two **"** from the beginning of the string and at the end of the string which will look like this, ```"i love programming in python"```. From here, we simply add that string and put it in side the **(**some_string**)**. So we end up having ```print("i love programming in python")```
